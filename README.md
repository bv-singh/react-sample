# React Sample

This is the React comment box example from [the React tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html).

## To use

There are several simple server implementations included.
They all serve static files from `public/` and handle requests to `users.json` & `roles.json` to fetch or add data. Start a server with one of the following:

### Node

```sh
npm install
node server.js
```


##Development
Run the following command after making the changes in example.js file.

```
browserify -t reactify public/scripts/example.js -o public/scripts/bundle.js
```

And visit <http://localhost:3000/>. Try opening multiple tabs!
